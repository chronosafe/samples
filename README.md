# Code Samples for Richard Brown

Included are samples of code from two of my latest projects, the iPhone app [VIN Hunter Pro](http://www.vinhunterpro.com) and a site I am currently working on [VIN Vault](http://www.vinvault.com) that provides data for web and mobile apps written in Ruby on Rails.

Each set of files has its own `README` file that explains the contents.

If you have any questions or wish any clarification please contact me at [chronosafe@gmail.com](mailto:chronosafe@gmail.com).
